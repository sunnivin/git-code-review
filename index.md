# Collaborative feedback with code reviews

The best way to make good work great.


To give a general definition of what a good code means is almost impossible. If you are working alone in a project you could say that good code is something that works. In the moment where you are collaborating with several people, and is developing a code base which were written in the past it starts to get hard.

## Motivation for doing code reviews in team work

At some point in the life cycle of a code base when the number of developers are increased from one to N there will come a point where someone will suggest changes which are not forseen or planed for in the original base. Suddenly you can find your self working in a big project where several persons, at different times, have contributed to the development of the code base.

## Sources
This lesson is build on the material given in the following sources:

- Blog entry by [ostrowski.ninja](https://ostrowski.ninja/code-review-practices/)
- [The Overflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/09/30/how-to-make-good-code-reviews-better/)
- [Google Engineering Practices](https://github.com/google/eng-practices)



> ## Prerequisites
>
> 1. Basic understanding of Git.
> 2. You need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
> 3. You need a project which where it has been performed some work. For instance the modular code development.
>
> We will do this exercise on [GitHub](https://github.com) but also
> [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) allow
> similar workflows and basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With
> this material and these exercises we do not endorse the company
> [GitHub](https://github.com). We have chosen to demonstrate a number of
> concepts using examples with [GitHub](https://github.com) because it is
> currently the most popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is high
> that you will interact with [GitHub](https://github.com)-based repositories even if you
> choose to host your Git repository on another platform.
