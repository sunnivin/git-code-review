# Code reviews make good work great
To give a general definition of what a good code means is almost impossible. If you are working alone on a project you could say that good code is something that works. At the moment where you are collaborating with several people and you are developing a codebase that was written in the past, it starts to get hard.

## Code reviews for teams
At some point in the life cycle of a codebase when the number of developers is increased from one to N there will come a point where someone will suggest changes that are not foreseen or planned for in the original base. Suddenly you can find yourself working on a big project where several persons, at different times, have contributed to the development of the codebase.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> 1. Basic understanding of Git.
> 2. You need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
> 3. You need a project which where it has been performed some work. For instance the modular code development.
>
> We will do this exercise on [GitHub](https://github.com) but also
> [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) allow
> similar workflows and basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With
> this material and these exercises we do not endorse the company
> [GitHub](https://github.com). We have chosen to demonstrate a number of
> concepts using examples with [GitHub](https://github.com) because it is
> currently the most popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is high
> that you will interact with [GitHub](https://github.com)-based repositories even if you
> choose to host your Git repository on another platform.
