## Some small changes in Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM)

The Community Land Model is the land model for the Community Earth System Model (CESM).

It is a collaborative project between scientists in the Terrestrial Sciences Section (TSS) and the Climate and Global Dynamics Division (CGD) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the CESM Land Model and Biogeochemistry Working Groups. Other principal working groups that contribute to the CLM are the Chemistry-Climate, Paleoclimate, Climate Change, and Land Ice Working Groups.

The code base is mainly developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), with a dedicated team of users and developers.
